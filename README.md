# Automating-Data-Science-with-CrewAI-Agents
This project demonstrates how multi-agent AI systems can automate the end-to-end data science lifecycle using CrewAI. Instead of a single monolithic model, specialized AI agents collaborate to perform data understanding, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insight generation.
