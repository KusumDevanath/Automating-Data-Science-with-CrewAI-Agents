# Automating Data Science with CrewAI Agents

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how **agentic AI systems** can automate the complete data science lifecycle using **CrewAI**. 
Instead of relying on a single monolithic pipeline or AutoML black box, this system models a real-world data science team 
by assigning specialized responsibilities to multiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously.

The project focuses on **regression-based predictive analytics** and showcases how tasks such as data understanding, 
feature preparation, model training, evaluation, and reporting can be orchestrated with minimal human intervention.

This work is designed as a **Master’s-level project** suitable for applications to MS programs in Artificial Intelligence, 
Data Science, and Machine Learning in the United States.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional data science workflows are:
- Manual and time-intensive
- Difficult to scale across datasets and teams
- Prone to human bias and inconsistency
- Hard to reproduce reliably

While AutoML tools exist, they often function as opaque systems with limited interpretability.

**Objective:**  
Design an **intelligent, transparent, and modular multi-agent system** that automates data science workflows while 
maintaining explainability and extensibility.

## 🧠 Solution Approach
This project introduces an **AI-powered data science team** built using CrewAI.  
Each agent has:
- A well-defined role
- Explicit responsibilities
- Clear communication pathways

The agents collaborate to simulate how professional data scientists work together in enterprise environments.
