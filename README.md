# Automating-Data-Science-with-CrewAI-Agents
This project demonstrates how multi-agent AI systems can automate the end-to-end data science lifecycle using CrewAI. Instead of a single monolithic model, specialized AI agents collaborate to perform data understanding, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insight generation.
# Motivation
Traditional data science workflows are manual, time-consuming, and difficult to scale.
This project explores how agentic AI can:
Reduce human effort
Improve reproducibility
Enable scalable and autonomous analytics pipelines
# Architecture
Data Analyst Agent – Performs EDA and feature understanding
ML Engineer Agent – Trains and tunes regression models
Evaluator Agent – Compares metrics and validates results
Manager Agent – Orchestrates tasks and agent communication
# Key Features
End-to-end automated ML workflow
Multi-agent collaboration using CrewAI
Regression model training and evaluation
Modular, extensible agent design
# Tech Stack
Python
CrewAI
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
Jupyter Notebook
# Results
The system successfully automates model training and evaluation, demonstrating how agent-based AI systems can replace
manual data science workflows with minimal human intervention.
